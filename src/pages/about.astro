      <ul class="space-y-4 text-neutral-700 text-justify leading-relaxed">
        <li>
          I’m a software engineer who enjoys turning ideas into real working systems.  
          I do my best to focus on developing structured, maintainable solutions that can keep a continiously growth and make sense to the people who use them.
        </li>
        <li>
          My experience goes on backend and full-stack development with <strong>.NET, C#, SQL, and Blazor</strong>,  
          working across different project stages, from architecture and APIs to deployment and maintenance.  
          I’ve also worked with <strong>Azure, AWS and Firebase</strong>, applying cloud tools to improve scalability and performance.
        </li>
        <li>
          I care about how things are established, built and how teams work together.  
          For me, good software comes from clear structure, open communication and attention to small details that can generate a really big impact on customers/users.
        </li>
        <li>
          I’m a curious person and I do enjoy learning new disciplines on design, data structures and technology raising methods  
          to build meaningful tools that help people work smarter and think differently.
        </li>
